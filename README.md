# pandas-data-manipulation
I have done this project to manipulate CSV file data using pandas.
Add new columns in the file on the basis of some calculation on the existing coulums values.
Split the CSV file into multiple sub CSV files on the basis of some columns value condition like if one coulum value is less then the other column value.
Save the file result into csv file.
